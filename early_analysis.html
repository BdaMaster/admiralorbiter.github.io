    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In today's world, we are spoiled with a plethora of advanced software and computing power that help us sort,
        analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data. From machine learning algorithms to big data analytics, the tools
        at our disposal are incomparably sophisticated. But have you ever stopped to wonder how society made sense of
        data before the digital age? Here's a brief journey through time to explore how people navigated the realm of
        data in the past.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1800s: The Age of Basic Tools</h2>
      <h3>Hand-Drawn Graphs</h3>
      <p>Long before the invention of electronic spreadsheets, people relied on hand-drawn graphs to visualize data.
        William Playfair, a Scottish engineer and political economist, is credited with inventing various types of
        graphs like the line graph, bar chart, and pie chart in the late 18th century.</p>

      <h3>The Birth of Averages</h3>
      <p>The concept of the "average" became a popular tool for summarizing data. Simple measures like mean, median, and
        mode were the go-to metrics for understanding large datasets. These were especially useful in fields like
        astronomy, where data points were collected manually through telescopic observations.</p>

      <h3>Census Taking</h3>
      <p>Governments started to realize the importance of data for governance and began conducting censuses. The data
        collected was usually tabulated manually and used to make informed decisions about resource allocation.</p>
        <center><img src="census.png" alt="Census" height="250px"></center>
      <h3>Probability Theory</h3>
      <p>The 19th century also saw significant developments in probability theory, spurred in part by interests in games
        of chance. This laid the groundwork for more complex statistical analysis in the future.</p>

    <!-- 1900s: The Era of Statistical Theories -->
    <section>
      <h2>1900s: The Era of Statistical Theories</h2>
      <h3>Statistical Sampling</h3>
      <p>With the rise of mass production and increased complexity in social systems, it became impractical to collect
        data from every individual item or person. Statistical sampling techniques, like random sampling, became vital
        for making generalizations about larger populations.</p>

      <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
      <p>The early to mid-20th century saw the development of hypothesis testing as a standard method for drawing
        conclusions from data. The t-test, Chi-square test, and ANOVA became common statistical methods used in research
        across various fields.</p>

      <h3>Multivariate Analysis</h3>
      <p>As datasets became more complex, statistical theories expanded to accommodate multiple variables. Techniques
        like regression analysis, factor analysis, and principal component analysis became essential tools in the
        statistician's toolbox.</p>

      <h3>Birth of Computational Statistics</h3>
      <p>Though not yet in the age of personal computers, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed the use of
        mainframe computers for more complicated statistical calculations. This era set the stage for the computational
        power that we take for granted today.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>While we may have advanced computational tools at our fingertips today, it's fascinating to see how far we've
        come from the rudimentary methods of the past. The journey of data analysis is a testament to human ingenuity
        and the relentless quest for understanding the world through numbers.</p>
      <p>So the next time you run a complex machine learning algorithm or visualize data in a flashy dashboard, take a
        moment to appreciate the centuries of statistical thought that laid the foundation for our modern capabilities.
