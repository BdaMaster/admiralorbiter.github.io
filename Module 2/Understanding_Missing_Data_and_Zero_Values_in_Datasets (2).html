            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Data preparation is a crucial but often overlooked step in the data analytics pipeline. Before you can perform any meaningful analysis, it's essential to understand the nature of your data, including how to deal with missing values and zero values. This article aims to explore these two concepts and offer guidelines on how to handle them effectively.</p>

            <h2>Missing Data vs Zero Values</h2>
            <p>Missing data refers to the absence of values for certain variables in your dataset. It could be the result of errors during data collection, or it may occur when certain observations are not applicable for all attributes. Zero values, on the other hand, indicate that the attribute being measured exists but has no magnitude. Treating missing data and zero values the same can lead to incorrect conclusions.</p>

            <h2>How to Handle Missing Data</h2>
            <p>One simple way to handle missing data is to delete observations that have missing values. However, this can result in loss of valuable information. Imputation involves replacing missing values with statistical estimates, such as the mean, median, or mode of the available data. Advanced techniques like machine learning-based imputation can also be used.</p>

            <h2>How to Handle Zero Values</h2>
            <p>The treatment of zero values largely depends on the context. In some cases, zero is a valid data point; in others, it may signify an issue that needs investigation.</p>

            <h2>Quiz or Interactive Component</h2>
            <p>Consider this small dataset for monthly sales figures. Would you treat the missing data for February and the zero sales for March the same way? Try applying different techniques and observe how they affect the dataset's statistics.</p>
