            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>When analyzing data, you're often looking for patterns or trends that can inform your decisions. However, every so often, you might come across data points that seem out of place. These are known as anomalies, and how you deal with them can significantly impact your analysis.</p>

            <h2>Types of Anomalies</h2>
            <p>Point anomalies are single instances that deviate significantly from the rest of your data. Contextual anomalies are only unusual within a specific context. Collective anomalies are a collection of data points that collectively deviate from the entire dataset but may not be anomalies when considered individually.</p>

            <h2>Handling Anomalies</h2>
            <p>Various statistical and machine learning techniques can help you identify anomalies. Once identified, they should not be ignored. They can be an accepted risk, or perhaps indicative of an error or fraud. The treatment varies based on the context and the potential impact on your analysis.</p>

            <h2>Interactive Component</h2>
            <p>Here's an interactive scatter plot of a fictional company's monthly sales. Identify the anomalies and decide how you would treat them. Would you investigate further, or consider them as an accepted risk?</p>
