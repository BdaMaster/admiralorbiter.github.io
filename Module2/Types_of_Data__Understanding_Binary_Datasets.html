            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Data comes in various shapes and sizes, but one of the most fundamental classifications is the type of data you're dealing with. Understanding this classification can help you make better decisions during analysis. In this article, we will zoom in on binary data, one of the simplest yet most powerful types of data.</p>

            <h2>What is Binary Data?</h2>
            <p>Binary data is a type of categorical data that has only two possible values. In many cases, these values represent opposites like true/false, yes/no, or 1/0. Because there are only two options, binary data is incredibly efficient to store and quick to analyze.</p>

            <p>Now that you know what binary data is, let's put it into practice. Imagine you have a dataset of customer reviews with ratings from 1 to 5. How could you transform this into a binary dataset?</p>
