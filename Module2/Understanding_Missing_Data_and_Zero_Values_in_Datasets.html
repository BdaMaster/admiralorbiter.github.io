      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Data preparation is a crucial but often overlooked step in the data analytics pipeline. Before you can perform
        any meaningful analysis, it's essential to understand the nature of your data, including how to deal with
        missing values and zero values. This article aims to explore these two concepts and offer guidelines on how to
        handle them effectively.</p>

        <h2>Missing Data vs Zero Values</h2>
        <p>Missing data refers to the absence of values for certain variables in your dataset. It could be the result of
          errors during data collection, or it may occur when certain observations are not applicable for all
          attributes. Zero values, on the other hand, indicate that the attribute being measured exists but has no
          magnitude. Treating missing data and zero values the same can lead to incorrect conclusions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card col-sm-3 m-2">
        <h2>How to Handle Missing Data</h2>
        <p>One simple way to handle missing data is to delete observations that have missing values. However, this can
          result in loss of valuable information. Imputation involves replacing missing values with statistical
          estimates, such as the mean, median, or mode of the available data. Advanced techniques like machine
          learning-based imputation can also be used.</p>

      <div class="card col-sm-3 m-2">
        <h2>How to Handle Zero Values</h2>
        <p>The treatment of zero values largely depends on the context. In some cases, zero is a valid data point; in
          others, it may signify an issue that needs investigation.</p>

      <h2>A Cautionary Tale</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a retail company, "RetailRise". In its initial analysis of monthly sales data, RetailRise noticed a
        month with zero sales for one of its top-selling products. The analytics team quickly jumped to the conclusion
        that the product wasn't appealing to consumers anymore. Simultaneously, they observed missing data for another
        month and assumed it meant zero sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, upon deeper investigation, it was discovered that the missing data was due to an unintentional error
        during data collection. In reality, the product had seen strong sales that month. The zero sales in another
        month was an accurate representation, indicating a genuine issue with the product's demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        By treating missing data and zero values the same, RetailRise initially misinterpreted its sales trends, which
        could have led to flawed business decisions. This story underlines the crucial distinction between missing data
        and zero values and the importance of handling each appropriately in data analysis.
