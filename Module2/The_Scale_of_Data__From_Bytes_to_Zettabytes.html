            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the age of big data, it's easy to get lost in the vastness of the information we generate and consume every day. But what do terms like 'megabyte,' 'gigabyte,' or 'petabyte' actually mean? Understanding the scale of data can help you make more informed decisions, whether you're buying a new hard drive or working on a data-intensive project.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Data Sizes</h2>
            <p>Data is typically measured in bytes, and each unit is a multiple of the byte. The hierarchy goes as follows: Byte, Kilobyte (KB), Megabyte (MB), Gigabyte (GB), Terabyte (TB), Petabyte (PB), Exabyte (EB), Zettabyte (ZB).</p>

            <h2>Real-world Examples</h2>
            <p>A standard MP3 song is about 5MB. A high-definition movie can take up to 2GB. Large corporations might need petabytes of storage for their operations. Global internet traffic is moving towards the zettabyte scale.</p>

            <h2>Interactive Component</h2>
            <p>Here's a fun exercise: use a slider to select a data size unit and see examples of what kind of data fits into that size. For instance, what could you store in 1TB of space? How many photos, songs, or movies would fit?</p>
