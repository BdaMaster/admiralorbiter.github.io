            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the fast-paced world of data analytics, both accuracy and speed are of the essence. However, there are instances where you might feel compelled to sacrifice one for the other. This article explores the trade-offs between data accuracy and the speed of data collection or analysis, and when each aspect should take precedence.</p>

            <h2>When Speed Matters</h2>
            <p>In scenarios like real-time analytics for emergency services or stock trading, speed is critical. However, it's essential to note that even in these cases, a baseline level of accuracy must be maintained.</p>

            <h2>When Accuracy is Non-negotiable</h2>
            <p>In scientific research, data accuracy is often non-negotiable. Erroneous data can not only invalidate the research but also have broader implications.</p>

            <h2>Striking the Balance</h2>
            <p>Often the decision between speed and accuracy is not binary. Techniques such as data sampling can provide quicker insights while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy.</p>
